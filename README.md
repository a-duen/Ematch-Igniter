It can also be found in the file "Igniter User's Guide.pdf"

## Notes on the design
This was designed over the course of one afternoon to fill an urgent need.  It has been thoroughly tested but \
its design was never reviewed or revisited.  It works well but the limitations of the system are spelled out \
in the attached pdf file, which also includes ideas on how to improve on the design if you wish to use this as a  \
starting point for your own design.

## CKT file
Use CircuitMaker 6.0 to open the ematch-igniter.ckt file \
A copy of CircuitMaker 6.0 is included in the folder, \
it should be good to go after unzipping it.
